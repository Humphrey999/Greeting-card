# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- # Greeting-Cards
A Vite and React app to display greeting messages
Project Overview
The Greeting Cards App is a web application built using React and Tailwind CSS that displays greeting cards. The app features a header with the title "Welcome to Greeting Cards" and three greeting cards that include images, titles, and messages.

Key Features:
Header: Displays a welcome message.
Greeting Cards: Three cards with custom images, titles, and messages.
Responsive Layout: Uses Tailwind CSS to ensure that the greeting cards are responsive and look good on different screen sizes.

Screenshots
A folder with screenshots of the application has been added. 

Discussion
Working on this project was a great but trying learning experience the hardest part was ensuring the images were properly loaded and styled, but once I understood the correct way to reference images in a React app, it clicked.
